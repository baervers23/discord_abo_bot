# Discord Subscription/Abonnement Bot

I created a discord bot for subscriptions, i use it for jellyfin together with a modified "membarr" bot.
Member with Subscription automatically gets a specific role, this role will cooperate with my customized membarr bot which activates and deactivates jellyfin

at the moment the bot answers in german, i translate it when i finish developing

# Working

# Create a Discord Bot
 1) Create the discord server that your users will get member roles or use an existing discord that you can assign roles from
 2) Log into https://discord.com/developers/applications and click 'New Application'
 3) (Optional) Add a short description and an icon for the bot. Save changes.
 4) Go to 'Bot' section in the side menu
 5) Uncheck 'Public Bot' under Authorization Flow
 6) Check all 3 boxes under Privileged Gateway Intents: Presence Intent, Server Members Intent, Message Content Intent. Save changes.
 7) Copy the token under the username or reset it to copy. This is the token used in the docker image.
 8) Go to 'OAuth2' section in the side menu, then 'URL Generator'
 9) Under Scopes, check 'bot' and applications.commands
10) Copy the 'Generated URL' and paste into your browser and add it to your discord server from Step 1.
